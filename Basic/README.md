1) Palindrome1 ------A basic problem statement where we check reverse of a number is same to original or not.
2) count_digits1 ------A basic problem statement where we count number of digits in a number entered by user.
3) reverse1 ------A basic problem statement where we reverse the number entered by the user and show it.
4) digitsum1 ------A basic problem statement where we find the sum of all digits of a number entered by the user.
5) factorial1 ------A basic problem statement where we calculate factorial of a number entered by user(iterative approach).
6) factorial2 ------A basic problem statement where we calculate factorial of a number entered by user(using recursion).
7) factorial3 ------A basic problem statement where we calculate factorial of a number entered by user(for large values too).
8) TrailingZeroesFactorial1 ------An interesting problem statement where we need to find trailing zeroes in factorial of a number entered by user.
9) Gcd1 -------A basic problem statement where we find gcd of two numbers entered by user(has larger time complexity than others).
10) Gcd2 -------A basic problem statement where we find gcd of two numbers entered by user(using Euclid's Algo which takes less iterations).
11) Gcd3 -------A basic problem statement where we find gcd of two numbers entered by user(using efficient Euclid's algo which takes even less iterations and time).
12) Prime1 ------A basic problem statement where we find whether entered number by user is prime or not. 
13) Prime2 ------A basic problem statement where we find whether number entered is prime or not(more efficient code).
