1) Palindrome1 ------A basic problem statement where we check reverse of a number is same to original or not.
2) count_digits1 ------A basic problem statement where we count number of digits in a number entered by user.
3) reverse1 ------A basic problem statement where we reverse the number entered by the user and show it.
4) digitsum1 ------A basic problem statement where we find the sum of all digits of a number entered by the user.
5) factorial1 ------A basic problem statement where we calculate factorial of a number entered by user(iterative approach).
6) factorial2 ------A basic problem statement where we calculate factorial of a number entered by user(using recursion).
7) factorial3 ------A basic problem statement where we calculate factorial of a number entered by user(for large values too).
8) TrailingZeroesFactorial1 ------An interesting problem statement where we need to find trailing zeroes in factorial of a number entered by user.
